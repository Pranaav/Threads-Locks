Firstly i complete node function which return its priority and value;

then i made queue in queue firstly i changed nodebase<V> to object to make a genric array then in constructor i initialize queue and also initialize other 
variables to 0; then for size function i return currentSize variable; for isEmpty function i check whether currentSize is zero or not; for isFull function i 
check whether currentSize == capacity(size of the array) or not; then for enque function firstly i check if queue is full or not and if not full then add 
element into it and change rear to rear+1)%capacity this make my queue to circular queue and finally increasing currentSize by 1; and for dequeue function 
firstly i check whether it is empty or not if empty then take out element at index front and then front = front+1)%capacity again for circular queue and 
finally decreasing currentSize by 1;

priority queue:- in priority queue (isEmpty, isFull, Size and constructor) is nearly same for enqueue firstly i check if it is full or not if not then i add 
an element at index currentSize and increase currentSize by 1; for dequeue i check if it is empty or not if not then take out that node whose priority(int) is 
minimum and note its index then shift all index(after that index) by 1 to left and decrease currentSize by 1 and finally return node;

buy function in buyer :- firstly i put lockon threads then go to try and put while loop till there is greater than or equal to one element to buy in catalog 
after coming out of while loop i dequeue one element from catalog; and then i go to finally where i give signal to full if it is awaiting which means that 
catalog is no more full now and then unlock my lock;

sell function in seller :- firstly i put lock then go to try and put while loop till there is spacein catalog  to sell(add element in catalog) a element after 
coming out from while loop firstly i check inventory is empty or not if not then i enqueue one element to catalog and then in finally give a signal to empty 
if it is awaiting which means catalog is not empty now and then unlock my lock for threads;

Assignment2 driver :- firstly i add all element from list(Arraylist) to inventory queue; 
threads:- firstly i put for loop of sellers then making new seller objects for seller threads and start them one by one through for loop;
then applied for loop for buyers then making new buyers objects for buyer threads and start them one by one with help of for loop.
